Meal Planning Website with Llama AI Integration
This project is a meal planning website that leverages Llama AI for generating meal plans based on user preferences. It consists of a Node.js backend and a React frontend.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

1. Node.js
Download and install Node.js from the official website. This will also install npm (Node Package Manager), which is required for managing dependencies.
2. Git (optional)
If you want to clone the repository, install Git from the official website.
Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meal-planning-website.git
cd meal-planning-website
2. Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate to the backend directory (if your structure is separated into frontend and backend) and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
3. Install Frontend Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
4. Configure the Node.js Backend
Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your Hugging Face API key:
plaintext
Copy code
HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=your_hugging_face_api_key
Modify Server Port (if necessary):

Ensure the server listens on the correct port. You can change the port in the server.js file if needed.
5. Run the Backend Server
In the backend directory, start your Node.js server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
6. Run the Frontend Application
In the frontend directory, start your React application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
7. Access the Application
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the meal planning website.

Usage
Enter your dietary preferences (e.g., "vegan", "low-carb") in the provided input area and click "Generate Meal Plan."
The application will fetch a meal plan generated by Llama AI based on your preferences.
Troubleshooting
Backend not responding: Ensure the Node.js server is running and accessible.
CORS issues: If you're having CORS issues, verify that your backend is correctly set up to allow requests from your frontend.
Network errors: Check your API key and ensure it's valid.
